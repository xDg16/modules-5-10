Command: chmod +x bg_move.sh
Explanation: Makes the bg_move.sh script executable so it can be run from the terminal.

Command: ./bg_move.sh testdir
Explanation: Runs the script on the directory testdir. The script creates testdir/backup if needed, moves each top-level regular file into backup/ in the background (using &), prints each background process PID ($!), then waits for all PIDs to finish and reports their exit status.

Command: ls -l testdir/backup
Explanation: Lists files in the backup directory to verify the files were successfully moved.

Command: ./bg_move.sh
Explanation: Running without an argument prints a usage message; the script requires one directory path.
