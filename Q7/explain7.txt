Purpose: metrics.sh generates basic text metrics (longest, shortest, average word length, unique-word count) from the text in input.txt.
Command: chmod +x patterns.sh
Explanation: Makes the patterns.sh script executable so it can be run from the terminal.

Command: ./patterns.sh words.txt
Explanation: Runs the script on words.txt. The script normalizes input to lowercase, extracts words (letters only), and writes vowel-only words to vowels.txt, consonant-only words to consonants.txt, and words that start with a consonant and contain at least one vowel to mixed.txt. Outputs are sorted and duplicates removed.

Command: cat vowels.txt
Explanation: Displays words that contain only vowels.

Command: cat consonants.txt
Explanation: Displays words that contain only consonants.

Command: cat mixed.txt
Explanation: Displays words that contain both vowels and consonants and start with a consonant.

Command: ./patterns.sh
Explanation: Running without an argument prints a usage message because the script requires one input file.
