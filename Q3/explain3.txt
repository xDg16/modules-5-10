Command: chmod +x validate_results.sh
Explanation: Makes the validate_results.sh script executable so it can be run from the terminal.

Command: ./validate_results.sh marks.txt
Explanation: Runs the script on marks.txt. The script reads each student's RollNo, Name, and three marks, counts how many subjects each student failed (passing mark = 33), prints students who passed all subjects and those who failed exactly one subject, and prints the counts for each category.

Command: ./validate_results.sh
Explanation: Running the script without an argument shows a usage message; the script requires a marks file as a single argument.
