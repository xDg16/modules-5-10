nano signal_handling.c → creates the source file

gcc signal_handling.c -o signal_handling → compiles it

./signal_handling → runs it

fork() → creates children

kill() → sends signals

signal() → handles signals

exit() → graceful termination

Signal Handling:
Explanation: SIGTERM triggers a graceful shutdown message, while SIGINT triggers an interrupt-specific message. Both signals are handled using a custom signal handler.
