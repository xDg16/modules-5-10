1. nano zombie_prevention.c

Function:
Opens a text editor called nano and creates a file named zombie_prevention.c.

nano = text editor

zombie_prevention.c = C source file

You use it to write your C program.

2️. gcc zombie_prevention.c -o zombie_prevention

Function:
Compiles the C program into an executable file.

gcc = GNU C Compiler

zombie_prevention.c = input source file

-o zombie_prevention = output executable name

After this, you get a file called zombie_prevention.

3️. ./zombie_prevention

Function:
Runs the compiled program.

./ = current directory

zombie_prevention = executable file

Without ./, Linux won’t run it because it doesn’t trust random programs by name. Sensible system.

4. ps -el | grep Z

Function:
Checks for zombie processes.

ps = process status

-e = show all processes

-l = long format

| = pipe output to another command

grep Z = filter lines containing Z (zombie state)

If nothing shows, no zombies exist. Peace restored.
