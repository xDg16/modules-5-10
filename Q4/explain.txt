Command: ./emailcleaner.sh emails.txt

Command: cat valid.txt
Explanation: Displays the list of unique valid email addresses extracted and saved to valid.txt.

Command: cat invalid.txt
Explanation: Displays the list of unique invalid email addresses extracted and saved to invalid.txt.

Command: ./emailcleaner.sh
Explanation: Running the script without an argument shows a usage message; the script requires the emails file as a single argument.
